   The bot should now be online and ready to use in your Discord server!

## Usage

1. **Invite the Bot**: Add the bot to your Discord server using the OAuth2 URL generated in the Discord Developer Portal (ensure it has the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes).
2. **Use the `/watch` Command**:
   - Type `/watch` in any channel where the bot has permission.
   - Start typing a TV show or movie name to see autocomplete suggestions.
   - Select a show or movie from the suggestions.
   - Choose a season (for TV shows) and an episode from the interactive dropdown menus.
   - Click the generated streaming link to watch instantly!

## Example

```
/watch
[Type "Breaking Bad"]
[Select "Breaking Bad" from autocomplete]
[Choose Season 1]
[Choose Episode 1]
[Click the provided link to watch]
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot not responding?** Check your `.env` file for correct credentials and ensure the bot has proper permissions in your server.
- **No streaming links?** Verify your TMDB API key and ensure the show/episode is available on TMDB.
- **Errors during `npm start`?** Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly and Node.js (v16.9.0 or higher) is up-to-date.
